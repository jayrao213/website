          <h2>Trading Bot</h2>
          <h3>March 2025 - Present</h3>
          <p>- Building a full-stack algorithmic trading platform in Python that trains machine learning models on 10+ years of historical stock data to predict buy/sell signals</p>
          <p>- Integrating Polygon.io for historical and real-time data ingestion, and using scikit-learn and XGBoost to train and update predictive models daily</p>
          <p>- Executing automatic paper and live trades through Alpaca API, based on model-generated buy/sell signals</p>
          <p>- Architecting a FastAPI backend, containerizing with Docker, and deploying via Render to the cloud</p>
          <p>- Developing a cross-platform mobile app using JavaScript, React Native and Expo, featuring an intuitive UI that allows users to track performance and receive real-time trade alerts</p>

          <h2>Adaptive Microwave Interface</h2>
          <h3>September 2024 - December 2024</h3>
          <p>- Collaborated in a four-person team to design an accessible microwave interface for individuals with special needs at North Center Community Day Service</p>
          <p>- Designed and constructed a tactile dial and surrounding food icons using Onshape</p>
          <p>- Programmed and wired a Raspberry Pi Pico using MicroPython to announce selected food options by speaker, indicate the microwave’s power through an LED strip, and implement custom start/+10s buttons</p>
          <p>- Led user-centered design efforts: conducted research, observed client interactions, developed multiple mockups, and coordinated user testing to align the product with client needs</p>

          <h2>Robot Dog Training</h2>
          <h3>March 2024 - May 2024</h3>
          <p>- Developed a reinforcement learning framework in MATLAB and Simulink to train two quadruped robot dogs to walk autonomously</p>
          <p>- Created a neural network-based reward function to optimize gait patterns through simulated trial-and-error learning, ultimately achieving stable physical movement after extensive training</p>
